# Mythos
A procedural mythology generator written in Python made for world builders.  

- Right now it just generates gods with a range of nonsensical traits 
- Work has begun on the generating creation myths which will flow into a timeline of the mythology
- You can provide your own traits/powers/abilites in a .txt that the script will pull from to use as generation parameters
