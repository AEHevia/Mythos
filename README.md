# Mythos
A procedural mythology generator written in Python 

* Currently the code on the repo is the old original version of Mythos. I made it back when I first learned Python! 



# Instructions

Right now to run Mythos just download the Mythos folder and run! There will be some prompts asking you to generate creation myths and gods.
