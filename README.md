# Mythos
A procedural mythology generator written in Python 

* Currently the code on the repo is the old original version of Mythos. I made it back when I first learned Python! The current revision is being used for research and will be published once all changes are wrapped up :)



# Instructions

Right now to run Mythos just download the Mythos folder and run! There will be some prompts asking you to generate creation myths and gods.
